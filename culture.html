      <h1>Malaysian Fun Facts / Culture</h1>
      <p>Malaysia is located in Southeastern Asia, close to Thailand, Indonesia, & Singapore.</p>
      <p>Malaysia uses the alphabet language such as ABC, and our second language is English, so it is not that hard to speak over there :).</p>
      <p>In Malaysia, the government was ruled by a King and Queen for a long time.</p>
      <p>With constitutional changes, the country still has a King and Queen but is governed by a Prime Minister.</p>

      <p>As you can see in the photo above, the Malaysia flag looks similar to the United States, and the stripes also have a similar meaning.</p>
      <p>In the United States, we have 13 stripes for the original colonies, and in Malaysia, there are 13 stripes for the equality of the 13 member states.</p>

      <p>Wau is a traditional kite that is widely played by Malaysians. It is a unique craft with different shapes and sizes.</p>
      <p>Some can go up to a huge size and length as a few people or more are needed to handle it!</p>
      <p>The word "wau" comes from the shape of the wings that look like an Arabic letter "Wau."</p>
